# Credit Risk Classification

## Overview
The "credit-risk-classification" project employs supervised machine learning techniques to evaluate the accuracy of bank loan applications. The repository includes a Pandas notebook and a detailed report. These materials are focused on demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to financial data, specifically for assessing credit risk in loan applications. The project utilizes data provided in the "Resources" folder, with an emphasis on data processing, model implementation, and performance evaluation to derive meaningful insights into the creditworthiness of applicants, enhancing decision-making processes in the banking sector.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and predict the accuracy of loan applications using machine learning.

## Methodology
- The file lending_data.csv was processed and read into a pandas dataframe for further analysis.
- A logistic regression model was used to predict the type of loan to be classified, resampling was necessary to increase the accuracy.

## Findings
- The file credit-risk-analysis-report.md contains a full evaulation of the model and implications for usage.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Numpy, pathlib, sklearn, contained in a Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Use
- To run the notebook on your local environment, open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code using base Python 3.9.13
